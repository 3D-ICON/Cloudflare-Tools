A repo for user facing tools.
Currently, this includes:

======> mod_cloudflare.c

Based on mod_remoteip.c, this apache extension will replace the remote_ip variable in user's logs with the correct remote_ip sent from CloudFlare. 
This also does authentication, only performing the switch for requests originating from 204.93.173.0/24 (by default).

To install: 

# apxs2 -a -i -c mod_cloudflare.c

No further configuration is needed. However, if you wish to override the default values, the following directives are exposed:

* CloudFlareRemoteIPHeader 

This specifies the header which contains the original IP. Default:

CloudFlareRemoteIPHeader CF-Connecting-IP

* CloudFlareRemoteIPTrustedProxy 

This is the IP range from which we will allow the CloudFlareRemoteIPHeader to be used from. Default:

CloudFlareRemoteIPTrustedProxy 204.93.173.0/24

Note that on some Debian systems, you may have to add a LoadModule directive manually. This should look like:

LoadModule cloudflare_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_cloudflare.so

Replace /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_cloudflare.so with the path to mod_cloudflare.so on your system.

If you cannot find apxs or apxs2, on a Debian or Ubuntu distro you can install this tool with:

# apt-get install apache2-prefork-dev
